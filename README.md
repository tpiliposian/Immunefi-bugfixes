# 1. Raydium - Tick Manipulation

Reported by: @riproprip

Protocol: Raydium

Date: January 10, 2024

Bounty: $505,000 in RAY tokens

Raydium is an AMM with an integrated central order book system. Users can provide liquidity, perform swaps on the exchange, and stake the RAY token for additional yield.
A fundamental aspect of Raydium is the Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM).

The vulnerability was located within the [increase_liquidity](Raydium/increase_liquidity.rs) file of the Raydium protocol. It conducts several critical operations, including pool status validation, token amount calculations based on user-provided maximums, fee updates, and the actual increase of liquidity in the positionâ€™s state.

Ticks represent discrete price points in a CLMM. By defining a range with tick_lower and tick_upper, an LP specifies the boundaries within which their liquidity will be active.

The flaw was specifically in the conditional handling of the [tickarray_bitmap_extension](https://github.com/tpiliposian/Immunefi_bugfixes/blob/bde6c3486e58d91fff972cbdb12b8c4d56f2327f/Raydium/increase_liquidity.rs#L291):

```rust
let use_tickarray_bitmap_extension = pool_state.is_overflow_default_tickarray_bitmap(vec![tick_lower, tick_upper]);

[...]

if use_tickarray_bitmap_extension {
    Some(&remaining_accounts[0])
} else {
    None
}
```
